<h3>About the xtype library</h3>
</a>
<p>
The xtype library contains a collection of routines for some dynamically-allocated
data types I use in several of my projects; you are probably looking at this file
because you downloaded this library as part of the source code for some software
package of mine. I don't, at this stage, distribute it separately, though there
is no reason you can't separate it from whatever package it came from and use it
in your own projects (provided you obey the licence).
<p>
It provides a generic array type (XARRAY), a generic linked-list type (XLIST) and
a string type (XSTR), designed to take care of all the realloc()-ing required for
objects with dynamically-changing sizes.

<h3>Installation and uninstallation</h3>
</a>
<p>
The xtype library has been carefully written so that it should compile on any
ANSI C compiler; I used various incarnations of GCC for testing. Older
K&amp;R style compilers won't like the ANSI-style prototyping used, though I
suppose there's no reason it won't compile if the prototypes were removed
(better just get GCC).
<p>
To install the library, edit the top of the make file provided in the src directory
so that it matches your system and preferences. Then run 'make install' and the
library will install itself.
<p>
If the make file doesn't work for some reason (e.g. the command lines may be too
long for DOS/Windows to handle), it's easy enough to compile it manually. First,
compile each C source file into an object file. Then link all the object files
into 'xtype.X', where X is the extension your system uses for library files. Copy
the xtype.h file into your include directory and the library file into your
library directory.
<p>
Should you not want the library on your computer any more, simply delete the
xtype library and the xtype.h file.
