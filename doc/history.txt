********************************************************************************

New Features:

 - window positions are now saved between sessions.

 - the settings now allow the user to specify a default path to their databases
   and a path to the documentation.

 - HTML tags are now permitted to contain white space.

 - the "choose author" and "choose quotes" boxes now display the author's name
   and first few words of the quote, respectively, as well as the code.

 - when trying to open a database that does not previously exist, the program
   now asks for confirmation from the user before creating it.

 - there is now a "Browse" button in the add/edit-quote box to enable the user
   to select an author from the list.

 - the Quoteriser can now access read-only databases; previously, it tried to
   open every database for writing, even for Quote-of-the-Day.

 - all searches are now carried out using regular expression matching, using
   the GNU Rx library.

 - the Quoteriser now stores the paths to the last databases in use for easy
   access from the "File" menu.

 - the main window now has a vertical scroll bar for more convenient viewing of
   long quotes and biographies.

 - Quote-of-the-Day now has an "Again" option to choose another random quote
   without having to re-start the program.

 - new random signature generator (sig.exe).

 - the Quoteriser now has an "Edit" menu that allows the user to copy quotes to
   the clipboard as either text or metafiles.

 - there is now an "Import" option on the quote and author menus to allow
   importation of one database into the currently open one.

 - the "choose quote" amd "choose author" boxes now display a progressive count
   of the number of matches found.

 - new simple install script (install.cmd) - just makes some icons.

 - the names of the currently open databases are now displayed in the main
   window title.

 - there is now a font setting.

 - lots of little cosmetic improvements.



Bug Fixes:

 - the Quote-of-the-Day settings box was not defaulting the entries with the
   settings already present in the QUOTER.INI file.

 - the user is no longer allowed to add an author or quote with an empty code;
   such codes are impossible to delete, view or edit (and are just plain silly,
   besides).

 - the user must now enter text into a quote; other than null quote texts being
   silly, they could also cause program crashes later on.

 - there were several missing dependencies in the make file.

 - the HTML parser now ignores all white space (it used to behave a little
   strangely when parsing tab characters and carriage returns).

 - spaces were being inserted after HTML macros.

 - Quote-of-the-day never chose the first (GDBM-wise) quote in the database.


Other:

 - moved common code from the executables into the quoterdb.dll (database stuff)
   and quoter1.dll (miscellaneous stuff) libraries.

 - all the executables get their C library functions from quoter1.dll, reducing
   the size of the executables while not requiring users to have emxrt.zip
   installed on their systems.

 - lots of internal code changes to cater for the increasing size of the
   program and to improve robustness.

 - the documentation is now in HTML format

 - patches for the GNU Rx and GDBM makefiles are now packaged with the source
   distribution. The GDBM patch fixes a mistake that causes the Quoteriser to
   fail during compilation; the GNU Rx patch allows the GNU Rx library to be
   used without gnurx.dll and the EMX run-time libraries.

 - the make file has been re-written for easier maintenence

********************************************************************************

Bug Fixes:

 - Quote-of-the-Day did not disable the vertical scroll bar before a quote had
   been selected.

 - the instructions for using sig.exe with NewsReader/2 only worked for LAN
   connections.

 - the author's e-mail and WWW addresses have changed.

********************************************************************************
Finalised: Version 2.01 uploaded to Hobbes 10th June 1998
********************************************************************************

New Features:

 - the GENERIC macro has been added to allow compilation on non-OS/2 systems;
   in theory, any standard C compiler should be able to to compile a non-OS/2
   subset of Quoteriser programs (i.e. the ones that don't use the OS/2 GUI)
   using this macro.

 - added the -l flag to sig to cause it to print a warning if the output is
   longer than a given number of lines.

 - menu options to delete and edit the currently displayed author or quote have
   been added.

 - new -a and -s flags for sig to allow greater flexibility in choosing the
   output format.

 - sig now accepts multiple output files on the command line for more efficient
   generation of multiple signatures.

 - new -q <qdb> and -a <adb> options to load a quote or author database,
   respectively, on the Quoteriser command line.

 - searches for authors and quotes can now be aborted mid-search.


Bug Fixes:

 - replaced the stricmp() function with the Quoteriser's own function; stricmp()
   is not standard C and not all compilers have this function.

 - line length in input text files was previously limited to 1000 characters;
   there is no longer any limit.

 - authors without surnames had a comma printed before their names in the
   "choose author" dialogue box.


Other:

 - the '/' character is no longer supported for denoting command-line flags;
   this causes problems on Unix systems.

 - new quoterla.dll containing parsing routines (HTML and database compiler).
