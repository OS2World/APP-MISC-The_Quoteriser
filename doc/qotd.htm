<h1>The Quoteriser, Version 2.10</h1>
<h2>Quote-of-the-Day</h2>
</center>
<p>
Like any quote-of-the-day program, the Quoteriser's Quote-of-the-Day simply
chooses a random quote and displays it on the screen each time it is run.
So there's precious little to say about it.
<p>
Use <a href="quoter.htm">the main Quoteriser program</a> to set up
quote-of-the day parameters. Using the <a href="quoter.htm#set_qotd">Quote-of-the-Day
option</a>, set the name of the quote database and author database to use for
choosing random quotes. The quote database must be filled in for the Quote-of-the-Day
program to work (obviously). The author database is optional; if it is not set,
the random quotes will not be attributed to an author when displayed.
<p>
The <i>Exit</i> option on the main menu does exactly what it says.
<p>
The <i>Edit</i> menu gives the option of copying the current quote to the
clipboard, either as text or as a metafile. Copying the quote as text is
suitable for pasting into text editors and word processors; copying the
quote as a metafile is suitable for pasting into graphics application. Some
of the formatting will be destroyed when the quote is copied as text, as
not all Quoteriser HTML can be rendered in plain text (italices and boldface).
<p>
The <i>Again</i> option on the main menu will cause the program to select
another random quote, without needing to re-start the program.
