<h3>About the Quoteriser</h3>
</a>
<p>
The reader has probably gathered by now that the Quoteriser is a program for
managing quotes. If not, the author can only presume that the reader has
downloaded this file for no particular purpose and hopes that the reader is not
volume-charged on his or her Internet access.
<p>
The Quoteriser was written in the author's spare time to facilitate the
maintenance of the author's collection of quotes. The author hopes that others
might similarly find use for this program in the maintenance of their own
collections or to use as a browser for quote libraries.
<p>
In addition to being able to store, edit, search and view quotes, the Quoteriser
can similarly manage biographical details for authors. Indeed, the user can even
do away with the quotes altogether and use the application purely as a
biographical database manager.
<p>
Also provided is a quote-of-the-day facility, and a powerful random signature
generator (i.e. a quote-of-the-day inserted into the reader's e-mail signature).
<p>
Typesetting of quotes and biographies is achieved using simple HTML encoding.
<p>
The Quoteriser is traditionally an OS/2 Presentation Manager application, and
you will need to be using OS/2 to use the full gamut of Quotersier functions.
As of Version 2.10, however, some Quoteriser functions are available for any
platform that has an ANSI C compiler and the GNU GDBM library. There is no
official binary distribution for systems other than OS/2, however, so non-OS/2
users will have to compile it themselves (or find someone else who already
has).
<p>
Version 2.00 of the Quoteriser is a large improvement over version 1.00, with
a much better interface, several new features and a couple of minor bug-fixes.
Version 2.10 contains a few interface enhancements and a new (somewhat
experimental) database compiler. If the reader is interested in the details,
the author has compiled an <a href="history.txt">history of changes</a>.
<p>
More detailed information about how to use the Quoteriser and the facilities it
has been endowed with is available in the accompanying documentation:

<h3>Where to find the Quoteriser</h3>
</a>
<p>
Of course, since you're reading this document, one presumes that you know where
it came from. In case you've forgotten, or obtained the Quoteriser through
strange and obscure channels, I will upload new versions of the Quoteriser to
Hobbes, which the administrators, in their great wisdom, place in the os2/apps/misc
directory.
<ul>
<li>USA (official site): <a href="ftp://ftp-os2.nmsu.edu/pub">ftp://ftp-os2.nmsu.edu/pub</a>
<li>Australia: <a href="ftp://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/hobbes">ftp://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/hobbes</a>
<li>UK: <a href="ftp://micros.hensa.ac.uk/mirrors/hobbes">ftp://micros.hensa.ac.uk/mirrors/hobbes</a>
</ul>
<p>
There are other mirrors - see <code>mirrors.txt</code> on ftp-os2.nmsu.edu; as usual, choose
the one nearest (network-wise) to you.
<p>
The central point for the dissemination of information about the Quoteriser is on
the author's WWW site, <a href="http://www.zeta.org.au/~nps/software/quoteriser/index.html">

<h3>Installing and uninstalling the Quoteriser</h3>
</a>
<p>
This assumes that the reader is installing the Quoteriser from the binary
distribution (<code>quot210x.zip</code>); if the reader is using the source
distribution, please read the <a href="#source">Do-it-yourself executables</a>
section below.
<p>
The quot210x.zip file, when expanded (with -d if using PKZIP), automatically
creates the directory structure assumed by the Quoteriser - the reader has
probably already done this. The files are:
<table>
<tr><td><code>install.cmd      </code><td>- cheesy script for installing icons
<tr><td><code>readme.txt       </code><td>- tells the reader to read this file
<tr><td><code>bin\quoter.exe   </code><td>- the Quoteriser's main program
<tr><td><code>bin\quoterc.exe  </code><td>- the database compiler
<tr><td><code>bin\qotd.exe     </code><td>- the quote-of-the-day program
<tr><td><code>bin\quoterdb.dll </code><td>- supporting library
<tr><td><code>bin\quoterla.dll </code><td>- supporting library
<tr><td><code>bin\quoter1.dll  </code><td>- supporting library
<tr><td><code>bin\sig.exe      </code><td>- the random signature generator
<tr><td><code>doc\copying.txt  </code><td>- a copy of the GNU General Public License
<tr><td><code>doc\intro.htm    </code><td>- an introduction to the Quoteriser (this file)
<tr><td><code>doc\quoter.htm   </code><td>- documentation for the main program
<tr><td><code>doc\quoterc.htm  </code><td>- documentation for the database compiler
<tr><td><code>doc\qotd.htm     </code><td>- documentation for the quote-of-the-day program
<tr><td><code>doc\sig.htm      </code><td>- documentation for the random signature generator
<tr><td><code>doc\history.txt  </code><td>- history of changes made to the Quoteriser
<tr><td><code>etc\quoter.ico   </code><td>- the Quoteriser icon
</table>
<p>
The reader will probably want to create icons on the desktop to start up
<code>quoter.exe</code> (the interface to the database manager) and
<code>qotd.exe</code> (the quote-of-the-day program). This can be done
automatically by running the <code>install.cmd</code> script from the
Quoteriser's directory. Put a shadow of the Quote-of-the-day object in
the StartUp folder for a random quote to be displayed at every boot.
<p>
If the user decides to move the Quoteriser, the other file that will need to be
moved is <code>bin\QUOTER.INI</code>. This contains the settings information for
the Quoteriser. It is created by the Quoteriser main program when it needs it.
<p>
The random signature generator uses two environment variables, which the reader
might want to set in his or her <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> if the signature
generator is to be used regularly. These are:
<table>
<tr><td>QUOTER_QDB <td>- path to the quote database to get random quotes from, no extension (must exist)
<tr><td>QUOTER_ADB <td>- path to the author database to use, no extension (optional)
</table>
<p>
Should the reader decide that the Quoteriser is absorbing too much valuable disk
space, or it is banned in the reader's country (?), or something of the sort,
uninstalling the Quoteriser is as easy as installing it. Simply delete
everything in the directory the Quoteriser was installed into, and all the
directories below it. Delete any icons or folders that were created, and the reader's
system will never know that it was ever there: &quot;rm -rf *&quot; - the ultimate
uninstaller.

<a name="source">
<h3>Do-it-yourself executables</h3>
</a>
<p>
The complete C source code for this version of the Quoteriser is available to
the compiling public. If the reader wishes to compile his or her own version of
the Quoteriser, he or she requires three files (these are the names of the OS/2
distributions; other systems may have variants, such as *.tar.gz for Unix):
<ul>
<li><code>quot210s.zip</code> - the Quoteriser's source code
<li><code>gnugdbm.zip</code> - the GNU database manager
<li><code>gnurx.zip</code> - the GNU Rx (regular expression) library; though any other
   regular expression library that happens to be lying around can probably
   be made to work. This is not required for non-OS/2 compilation.
</ul>
<p>
The Quoteriser source code should be available from the same source as the
executables (<code>quot210x.zip</code>). The GNU database files are available from
ftp.leo.org and several other places (all in Germany, for some reason),
and the GNU Rx library is available from Hobbes, amongst other places.
<p>
It is a condition of the license for this product that the source code is either
distributed with the executables or available upon request. The author will,
therefore, be prepared to offer any assistance necessary in obtaining the above
two files if he is contacted by any rightful licensee of the product.
<p>
Further documentation on compilation of the source code is distributed in the
<code>quot210s.zip</code> file.

<h3>The future</h3>
</a>
No, the Quoteriser 2.10 isn't the perfect application. The following is a list
of some of the things the author has on his to-do list:
<ul>
<li>colour selection
<li>boolean search functions
<li>on-line, context-sensitive help
<li>add the &lt;pre&gt; HTML tag
<li>HTML interpretation of all text by by the signature generator
<li>integration of compiler functionality into the GUI (but quoterc will remain)
<li>a more sophisticated compiler (but I am not going to re-write Perl)
<li>(possibly) an Internet quote-of-the-day server
<li>... and probably a lot more that the author thinks of between now
    and version 3.00. Current projections are that Version 3.00 <i>will</i> be
    the perfect application :-)
</ul>
<p>
The author will accept suggestions and feature requests to his e-mail address at
<a href="mailto:nps@zeta.org.au">nps@zeta.org.au</a>. Whether or not he acts on
them, and on what time scale, depends on how worthwhile he thinks the feature to
be and how much time he has on his hands. If the reader wishes to fiddle with the
source code him or herself, he or she is quite welcome to download
<code>quot210s.zip</code> and do so. The author will consider changes submitted
to him for inclusion in the official Quoteriser distribution, though he can't
guarantee it.

The Quoteriser's quote and biography database management is handled by the
GNU database manager library. This was written by Philip A. Nelson and
ported to OS/2 by Kai Uwe Rommel. Without this piece of software, the
Quoteriser would have been a lot longer in coming.
<p>
The Quoteriser's regular expression matching is provided by the GNU Rx
library, written by Tom Lord and ported to OS/2 by Kai Uwe Rommel. This
library allowed easy addition of a powerful Quoteriser feature.
<p>
The Quoteriser was developed using the EMX/GCC compiler, written by Eberhard
Mattes. This author cannot offer enough thanks to Eberhard and everyone else
who's contributed to GCC; the Quoteriser would probably not exist but for
them.
<p>
The Quoteriser icon was designed and drawn by John Bambrick, who also came up
with the name &quot;Quoteriser&quot;.
