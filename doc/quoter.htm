<h3>Basic Quoteriser notions</h3>
</a>
<p>
Every quote in a Quoteriser database is associated with a unique alpha-numeric
code that can be up to 19 characters long. Every author in an author database
similarly has a unique code up to 19 characters long. These codes are what the
program uses to uniquely identify the information stored in a database.
<p>
Databases are have filename extensions of <code>.?db</code>, where <code>?</code>
is one of <code>q</code>, <code>t</code>, <code>a</code> or <code>d</code>,
depending on what part of a database this file represents. When specifying
names of databases to the Quoteriser, the user must omit this extension; the
Quoteriser will fill in the necessary extensions in the process of opening
particular files.
<p>
The Quoteriser can be made to open databases at start-up by giving it the
<code>-q &lt;quote database&gt;</code> and <code>-a &lt;author
database&gt;</code> options on the command line.
<a name="qdb">
<h4>Quote databases</h4>
</a>
<p>
A quote database is composed of two files, <code>&lt;database&gt;.qdb</code> and
<code>&lt;database&gt;.tdb</code>, where <code>&lt;database&gt;</code> can be any
valid file name stem. Both files are GNU DBM files.
<p>
The <code>.qdb</code> file stores the following information about the quote:
<ul>
<li>a code identifying the quote's author [up to 19 characters]
<li>a string containing information about the quote's source [up to 99
    characters]
<li>up to five keywords describing the subject matter of the quote [each
    keyword can be up to 19 characters long]
</ul>
<p>
The author code is the one assigned to the quote's author in the author
database being used. Of course, there is nothing stopping anyone from having
the same author in two different databases with a different code, and this
may cause trouble when using the system. It is not recommended that the user
keeps more than one author database.
<p>
The <code>.tdb</code> file stores the text of the quote itself, which can be typeset
using <a href="#html">simple HTML commands</a> (see below).
<a name="adb">
<h4>Author databases</h4>
</a>
<p>
An author database is also composed of two files, <code>&lt;database&gt;.adb</code> and
<code>&lt;database&gt;.ddb</code>, where <code>&lt;database&gt;</code>, again, can be
any valid file name stem. Both these files are also GDBM files.
<p>
The <code>.adb</code> file stores the following information about the author:
<ul>
<li>the author's given name [up to 49 characters]
<li>the author's surname [up to 49 characters]
<li>the author's year of birth [up to 9 characters]
<li>the author's year of death [up to 9 characters]
</ul>
The <code>.ddb</code> file contains a free-form biographical entry for the author, which can
also be typeset with <a href="#html">simple HTML commands</a> described below.
<hr>
<a name="using">
<h3>Using the Quoteriser</h3>
</a>
<a name="databases">
<h4>Using Databases</h4>
</a>
<p>
Quote and author databases are open and closed like any other file using the
<i>File</i> menu. A quote database must be open to be able to use to use quote
management functions, and an author database must be open to be able to
use author management functions. Only one database of each type may be open at
once.
<p>
When trying to open a database, the standard OS/2 file dialogue will appear,
which shows <code>*.qdb</code> files (for quote databases) or <code>*.adb</code>
files (for author databases). A database that already exists can be opened in
the usual fashion, or a new database can be created by typing in the name of
the new database (the user will be asked to confirm creation). The
<code>*.tdb</code> and <code>*.ddb</code> files are assumed from the
<code>*.qdb</code> or <code>*.adb</code> file that is specified.
<p>
The last quote and author databases in use may also be opened quickly by
choosing the last option on the <i>File</i> menu, i.e. the option showing
the names of these databases. This option will not appear if there have been
no databases in use before.
<p>
In addition to the open and close functions on the <i>File</i> menu, there are
two more options to re-organise the quote database and the author database.
These functions will de-fragment the open database. When data is deleted from a
database, it leaves a gap. The Quoteriser will try to fill these gaps when new
information is stored in the database; however, if the database has undergone
a lot of deletions with few additions, packing the database in this fashion
may save space.
<p>
It may happen that the Quoteriser is not able to gain write access to the
database, e.g. if the database has been marked as read-only, or it has been
already opened by another application. In this case, functions requiring
write access (such as adding, editing and re-organising) will be disabled.
<a name="quotes">
<h4>Managing quotes</h4>
</a>
Once a quote database has been opened, the quotes within can be manipulated
using the <i>Quote</i> menu. The user can add a new quote, edit or delete
old quotes, view/search the quotes, and import quotes from another database.
<p>
To add a new quote, choose the <i>Add</i> option from the <i>Quote</i> menu.
A dialogue box into which to enter quote information will appear. The quote
code <i>must</i> be specified; all other entries are optional.
<p>
In the <i>Keywords</i> entry field, the keywords should be separated by
spaces.
<p>
The text of the quote can be edited by pressing the <i>Text</i> button. This
will start the text editor specified in the <a href="#settings">settings</a>,
where the quote text can be typeset using <a href="#html">simple HTML</a>.
Make sure the file is saved before pressing the <i>Okay</i> button.
<p>
Pre-existing quotes can be edited by choosing <i>Edit</i> from the <i>Quote</i>
menu. The user can edit the current quote (if there is one), or choose from the
list of quotes in the database. A dialogue box like the one used for adding
quotes will appear, which can be used to edit the quote as necessary using the
same procedure.
<p>
Quotes can be deleted by choosing <i>Delete</i> from the <i>Quote</i> menu.
The user can delete the current quote (if there is one), or choose from the
list of quotes in the database. Warning: there is no undelete function, so be
careful.
<p>
Quotes in the database can be viewed using the <i>View</i> sub-menu of the
<i>Quote</i>. Each option of the <i>View</i> sub-menu causes a different
list of quotes to be displayed for choosing:
<dl>
<dt><i>List all</i>
<dd>Lists all quotes in the database.
<dt><i>By keyword</i>
<dd>Lists all the quotes associated with a particular keyword; the user will
    be asked to type this in. <a href="#regexp">Regular expressions</a> may be
    used.
<dt><i>By text</i>
<dd>Lists all the quotes containing a <a href="#regexp">regular expression</a>
    given by the user.
<dt><i>By author</i>
<dd>Lists all the quotes from a given author, which can be selected from the
    list of authors in the currently open author database. This option is not
    available if there is no author database open.
</dl>
<p>
Another database can be imported into the currently-open database by choosing
the <i>Import</i> option from the <i>Quote</i> menu. The user will be presented
with a dialogue box asking for the name of the database to import, and giving
several options for what to do about codes which exist in both the open database
and the database being imported:
<dl>
<dt><i>Replace all</i>
<dd>Replace quotes in the open database with ones from the database being imported.
<dt><i>Replace none</i>
<dd>Do not import any quotes whose code already exists in the open database
<dt><i>Ask</i>
<dd>Prompt the user for action whenever a duplicate code is found.
</dl>
The <i>Duplicate codes</i> setting does not affect codes being imported that do
not clash with codes already existing in the open database.
<a name="authors">
<h4>Managing authors</h4>
</a>
With an author database open, authors can be manipulated in exactly the same
way quotes are manipulated, using the <i>Author</i> menu. Adding, editing,
deleting and importing are the same. The <i>View</i> sub-menu has the
following options:
<dl>
<dt><i>List all</i>
<dd>Lists all the authors in the database
<dt><i>By name</i>
<dd>Lists all the authors with a name typed in by the user, which may be their
    given name or surname, and may be a <a href="#regexp>regular expression</a>.
<dt><i>By description</i>
<dd>Lists all the authors containing a <a href="#regexp>regular expression</a>,
    given by the user, in their descriptions.
</dl>
<a name="clipboard">
<h4>The clipboard</h4>
</a>
<p>
The Quoteriser can interact with other applications via the clipboard. When a
quote or author is displayed on the screen, it can be copied to the clipboard
using the <i>Edit</i> menu. Once copied to the clipboard, it can be pasted into
another application - see the other application's documentation for how to
paste into it.
<p>
<i>Copy as text</i> will copy the display to the clipboard as plain text,
suitable for pasting into text editors and word processors. This will destroy
some of the formatting of the quote; obviously italics and boldface cannot be
rendered in plain text. Line-wrapping will also be removed (to allow the
pasting application to wrap as it sees fit).
<p>
<i>Copy as metafile</i> will copy the display to the clipboard as a metafile,
suitable for pasting into graphics applications. This method will preserve all
of the formatting.
<hr>
<a name="settings">
<h3>Quoteriser settings</h3>
</a>
<a name="set_main">
<h4>Main settings</h4>
</a>
<p>
The main Quoteriser settings are accessed via the <i>Settings</i> option in the
<i>File</i> menu:
<dl>
<dt><i>Editor</i>
<dd>The name of the text (or HTML) editor to use for editing quote texts and
    author descriptions. The default is the OS/2 system editor, E.EXE.
<dt><i>Editor parameters</i>
<dd>Parameters to pass to the text editor; the % symbol represents the name
    of the file to edit. The default is '%'.
<dt><i>Path to data</i>
<dd>The default path in which to look for databases. There is no default.
<dt><i>Path to documentation</i>
<dd>The path to the Quoteriser documentation. The default is the 'doc'
    directory in the parent directory of the working directory.
<dt><i>Browser</i>
<dd>The name of the HTML browser to use (for viewing the documentation).
    The default is WebExplorer, EXPLORE.EXE
<dt><i>Browser parameters</i>
<dd>Parameters to pass to the HTML browser; the % symbol represents the
    name of the document to view. The default is '%'.
</dl>
<a name="set_qotd">
<h4>Quote-of-the-day settings</h4>
</a>
<p>
The <i>Quote-of-the-day</i> option brings up a dialogue box allowing the user
to specify settings for the quote-of-the-day program; namely, the name of the
quote database to select random quotes from, and the name of an author database
to provide author information.
<hr>
<a name="reference">
<h3>A Quoteriser reference</h3>
</a>
<a name="html">
<h4>Quoteriser HTML</h4>
</a>
<p>
The HTML understood by the Quoteriser is a tiny subset of the full HTML
standard; only elements thought to be useful in the typesetting of quotes
have been implemented.
<p>
The Quoteriser understands the following HTML tags:
<p>
<table border=0>
<tr><td>&lt;b&gt; ... &lt;/b&gt;  <td>- the enclosed text is in boldface
<tr><td>&lt;br&gt;                <td>- force a line break here
<tr><td>&lt;i&gt; ... &lt;/i&gt;  <td>- the enclosed text is in italics
<tr><td>&lt;p&gt;                 <td>- paragraph break
</table>
<p>
Other tags will be ignored.
<p>
The Quoteriser implements all the ISO Latin-1 macros; unrecognised macros
will be printed verbatim. Note that because the '&amp;', '&lt;' and '&gt;'
characters have special meaning in HTML, the &amp;amp; (&amp;), &amp;lt;
(&lt;) and &amp;gt; (&gt;) macros <i>must</i> be used to represent such
characters. The list of HTML macros may be obtained from the W3 Consortium,
<a href="http://www.w3.org">http://www.w3.org</a>.
<p>
Because the Quoteriser blindly sends the ISO Latin-1 codes to the screen,
some characters may display strangely if the current codepage/font does not
correspond to ISO Latin-1. There is no support at all for other character
sets, the author regrets to say (though one supposes fiddling with the
codepages and fonts might produce results for some alphabets).
<a name="regexp">
<h4>Regular expressions</h4>
</a>
<p>
(Note: if the reader has re-compiled the Quoteriser with a different
regular expression library to GNU Rx, this section may not accurately
describe the re-compiled Quoteriser - in this case, the author assumes
the reader either knows what he or she is doing, or can find out).
<p>
The Quoteriser uses the GNU Rx library to implement regular expression
matching. All regular expression matching is case insensitive and uses
extended regular expression syntax. All matches are sub-string matches.
The following is an incomplete description that is hopefully enough to
get the reader started.
<p>
<table border=1>
<tr><td nowrap>[ ]
    <td>Matches any one of the characters inside the square brackets.
        Ranges may be used, e.g. [a-z] to match any alphabetic
        character.
<tr><td nowrap>[^ ]
    <td>Matches any character <i>not</i> in the square brackets. Ranges
        may be used, e.g. [^a-z] to match any non-alphabetic character.
<tr><td nowrap>\
    <td>Take the following character literally, e.g. \\ match a backslash,
        \[ match a left square bracket.
<tr><td nowrap>.
    <td>Matches any single character
<tr><td nowrap>?
    <td>Match the preceding item zero or one times.
<tr><td nowrap>*
    <td>Match the preceding item zero or more times.
<tr><td nowrap>+
    <td>Match the preceding item one or more times.
<tr><td nowrap>{<i>n</i>}
    <td>Match preceding item <i>n</i> times.
<tr><td nowrap>{<i>n</i>,}
    <td>Match preceding item <i>n</i> or more times.
<tr><td nowrap>{,<i>m</i>}
    <td>Match preceding item at most <i>m</i> times.
<tr><td nowrap>{<i>n</i>,<i>m</i>}
    <td>Match preceding item at least <i>n</i> times and at most <i>m</i> times.
<tr><td nowrap>|
    <td>Match either the expression on the left or on the right.
<tr><td nowrap>( )
    <td>Used to alter order of precedence (similar to arithmetic).
</table>
<p>
Examples:
<p>
<table border=1>
<tr><td nowrap>[KC]arl
    <td>E.g. to find all authors named &quot;Carl&quot;, regardless of whether
        they spell their names with a C or a K
<tr><td nowrap>happ(y|iness)
    <td>E.g. to search for keyword &quot;happy&quot; or &quot;happiness&quot;
<tr><td nowrap>honou?r
    <td>E.g. to search for both the US and UK spellings of &quot;honour&quot;.
<tr><td nowrap>[aeiou]{3}
    <td>E.g. to find all quotes with three or more vowels in succession.
<tr><td nowrap>[ ',.&quot;;:]word[ ',.&quot;;:]
    <td>E.g. to match a whole word (&quot;word&quot;, in this case) only
</table>
<p>
Unfortunately, the author is unable to direct the keen reader to a good,
comprehensive regular expression reference; the best he can suggest is to
get the manual page for the grep utility.
