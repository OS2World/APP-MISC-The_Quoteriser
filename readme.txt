The Quoteriser - a quote management application

Version 2.10 (C) 1997-1998 Nicholas Paul Sheppard (nps@zeta.org.au)
The Quoteriser is distributed under the GNU General Public Licence (though it is
not an official GNU product), and comes with NO WARRANTY WHATSOEVER. See the
file doc/copying.txt for details.


There are two Quoteriser distribution files:

	quot210x.zip - compiled OS/2 binaries
	quot210s.zip - C source code

Presumably, the reader has at least one of them to be in the possession of this
file. Only one of the packages is required (though quot210s.zip will be useless
without a C compiler, of course).

Refer to doc/intro.htm for further information on installing and using the
Quoteriser, and to doc/source.htm for further information on compiling the
Quoteriser. If the reader has used earlier versions the Quoteriser, he or she
may wish to peruse doc/history.txt for the list of changes. Documentation for
this version of the Quoteriser is largely in HTML format and can be viewed with
a web browser.

The author hopes that the Quoteriser proves useful, interesting, educational
or some other worthy adjective.
